# Optimizing-Ride-Efficiency
Capstone project analyzing ride-sharing data to uncover trends in distance, fares, and efficiency using data preprocessing, visualization, and linear regression modeling.

## Overview
This project analyzes ride-sharing data to uncover trends in distance, fare pricing, and efficiency.  
By applying data preprocessing, visualization, and a linear regression model, the project provides actionable insights for:
- Optimizing driver allocation
- Reducing idle time
- Supporting fair and transparent fare structures

## Dataset
- Source: [Ride-Sharing Platform Data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adnananam/ride-sharing-platform-data?resource=download&select=rides.csv)
- 50,000 ride records with ride ID, user/driver IDs, locations, times, distances, and fare amounts.

## Methods
- Data cleaning: Missing values, outliers handled using IQR.
- Feature engineering: Ride durations, cost-per-km, etc.
- Visualization: Ride distances, fares, demand patterns.
- Modeling: Linear Regression (RÂ² = 0.86).

## Results
- Strong positive correlation between ride distance and fare amount.
- Transparent pricing insights to enhance customer satisfaction.
- Potential improvements: Include ride time, location, nonlinear models.

## Impact
- Fairer fares for riders
- Increased driver earnings
- Data-driven support for urban transport planning
